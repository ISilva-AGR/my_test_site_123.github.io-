<h1>Gender of Words</h1>

<p>
  In both Portuguese (PT) and Polish(PL), most words are gendered, such as nouns, adjectives, determiner, pronouns, etc.
</p>
  
<p>
  In the case of PT, words can either be masculine or feminine. Usually, if a words ends in 'o', it is masculine and if it ends in 'a', it is feminine. There can be exceptions to this, however - the word for lettuce, 'alface', ends in 'e' and it is feminine; the word for elephant, 'elefante', also ends in 'e', but it is masculine.

<p>
    In the case of PL, words can be masculine, feminine or neutral. Usually, if a words ends in a consonant or in 'y', it is masculine, if it ends in 'a', it is feminine, and if it ends in 'o', it is neutral. Some exceptions include the word for man, 'mężczyzna', which is masculine but ends in 'a', and the word for people, 'ludzie', which is also masculine, but end in 'e'.

<p>
  The woman is beautiful. - A mulher é bonita. - Kobieta jest piękna.' 
</p>

<p>
  The man is beautiful. - O homem é bonito. - Mężczyzna jest piękny.
</p>
    
<p>
  In the first PT example, the words 'A', 'mulher' and 'bonita' are all feminine. Although 'mulher' ends in 'r', the use of the feminine determiner 'A' denotes that the noun that follows it also feminine. Similarly, in the second PT example, 'O', 'homem' and 'bonito' are all masculine, and although 'homem' end in 'm', the use of the masculine determiner 'O' indicates that the noun is also masculine.
