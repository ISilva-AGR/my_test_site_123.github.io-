  <h1>Gender of Words</h1>

  <p><a href="index.html" target="_self">Homepage></a></p>
  
  <p>
    In both Portuguese (PT) and Polish (PL), most words are gendered, such as nouns, adjectives, determiner, pronouns, etc.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    In the case of PT, words can either be masculine or feminine.<br>
    Usually, if a words ends in '<span class="red">o</span>', it is masculine and if it ends in '<span class="blue">a</span>', it is feminine.<br>
    There can be exceptions to this, however:
    <ul>
      <li>The word for lettuce, 'alfac<span class="blue">e</span>', ends in '<span class="blue">e</span>' and it is feminine.</li>
      <li>The word for elephant, 'elefant<span class="red">e</span>', also ends in '<span class="red">e</span>', but it is masculine.</li>
    </ul>
  </p> 
  
  <p>
      In the case of PL, words can be masculine, feminine or neutral.<br>
      Usually, if a words ends in a <span class="red">consonant</span> or in '<span class="red">y</span>', it is masculine, if it ends in '<span class="blue">a</span>', it is feminine, and if it ends in '<span class="green">o</span>', it is neutral.<br>
      Some exceptions include:
      <ul>
        <li>The word for man, 'mężczyzn<span class="red">a</span>', which is masculine but ends in '<span class="red">a</span>'.</li>
        <li>The word for people, 'ludzi<span class="red">e</span>', which is also masculine, but ends in '<span class="red">e</span>'.</li>
      </ul>  
  </p>    
  
  <p>
    The <span class="blue">woman</span> is beautiful. - <span class="blue">A mulher</span> é <span class="blue">bonita</span>. - <span class="blue">Kobieta</span> jest <span class="blue">piękna</span>. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <span class="red">man</span> is beautiful. - <span class="red">O homem</span> é <span class="red">bonito</span>. - <span class="red">Mężczyzna</span> jest <span class="red">piękny</span>.
  </p>
      
  <p>
    In the first PT example, '<span class="blue">A</span>', '<span class="blue">mulher</span>' and '<span class="blue">bonita</span>' are all feminine.<br>
    Although '<span class="blue">mulher</span>' ends in '<span class="blue">r</span>', the use of the feminine determiner '<span class="blue">A</span>' denotes that the noun that follows it is also feminine.<br>
    Similarly, in the second PT example, '<span class="red">O</span>', '<span class="red">homem</span>' and '<span class="red">bonito</span>' are all masculine, and although '<span class="red">homem</span>' ends in '<span class="red">m</span>', the use of the masculine determiner '<span class="red">O</span>' indicates that the noun is also masculine.
